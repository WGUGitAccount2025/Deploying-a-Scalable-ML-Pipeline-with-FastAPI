## Intended Use

## Training Data

## Evaluation Data

## Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated with three main metrics:

Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the ability to identify all positive instances.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.

Overall performance:
Precision: 0.7242 | Recall: 0.6134 | F1: 0.6642
